Getting Started

The Scrutinizer Datasource must be cloned into the plugins directory on Grafana. 

You can find this datasource on github

This datasource must be cloned into your plugins directory. 

**Path:** 

* Linux : '*/var/lib/grafana/plugins*' 
* Windows : '*/data/plugins*'

When inside the directory issue the command. 

If your on a Windows System you may need to create the data directory.
