Runnings Reports
=================


Reporting is done primarily through populating the drop down menus.

The report will only rendor once you have selected something from each drop down or you have selected to add a filter. 

The data is going to be represented in bits / second. You will want to make sure Grafana is displaying it this way by updating the visualization field
